# Transfer System Component Library Development and Testing

This folder contains component library development and testing work for Bosch Rexroth transfer systems—modular conveyor solutions used in intralogistics and factory automation. The work encompasses systematic component modeling, validation, and performance evaluation.

Transfer system component CAD files were exported from MTpro, with component specifications and requirements derived from the Bosch Rexroth product catalogue. Visual Components was used for simulation component modeling and testing, employing rigorous validation methodologies to ensure functional accuracy and system integration. Further description for each transfer system variant is provided in the respective subfolders.
