# Transfer System (TS2) Stop Gate: Capacity Control
Modelled and implemented capacity-based control logic to the TS1 and TS2 Stop Gate, similar to the TS5 implementation, enabling sophisticated material flow management and congestion prevention. This approach enhances conveyor control by considering downstream capacity before accepting new products.
